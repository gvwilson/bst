## Making Decisions

This project uses Martha's Rules for consensus decision making:

1.  Before each meeting, anyone who wishes may sponsor a proposal by filing an issue in the GitHub repository tagged "proposal".
    Proposals must be filed at least 24 hours before a meeting in order to be considered at that meeting, and must include:
    -   a one-line summary (the subject line of the issue)
    -   the full text of the proposal
    -   any required background information
    -   pros and cons
    -   possible alternatives

2.  A quorum is established in a meeting if half or more of voting members are present.

3.  Once a person has sponsored a proposal, they are responsible for it.
    The group may not discuss or vote on the issue unless the sponsor or their delegate is present.
    The sponsor is also responsible for presenting the item to the group.

4.  After the sponsor presents the proposal,
    a "sense" vote is cast for the proposal prior to any discussion:
    -   Who likes the proposal?
    -   Who can live with the proposal?
    -   Who is uncomfortable with the proposal?

5.  If all of the group likes or can live with the proposal,
    it passes immediately.

6.  If most of the group is uncomfortable with the proposal,
    it is postponed for further rework by the sponsor.

7.  Otherwise,
    members who are uncomfortable can briefly state their objections.
    A timer is then set for a brief discussion moderated by the facilitator.
    After 10 minutes or when no one has anything further to add (whichever comes first),
    the facilitator calls for a yes-or-no vote on the question:
    "Should we implement this decision over the stated objections?"
    If a majority votes "yes" the proposal is implemented.
    Otherwise, the proposal is returned to the sponsor for further work.

## Development Process

1.  Use `discussion` to label general discussion threads,
    `proposal` to identify proposals that need to be voted on,
    and `bug` for things that need to be fixed.

1.  When starting work on a subject,
    create an issue labelled `in progress` and assign it to yourself.
    Use `help wanted` if you need assistance or want someone else to take it over
    and `ready for review` when the pull request is ready for review or being reviewed.

1.  The first draft for each topic should be point-form notes and working code.
    We will reorganize these once we have written enough to see overall scope.
