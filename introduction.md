## Who this book is for

Every lesson should be written with specific learners in mind.  These three
[personas][t3-personas] are ours:

-   Tanesya is in the third year of a four-year computer science degree. She worked
    on several volunteer projects in high school and through her mosque, but the
    "Introduction to Software Engineering" course she's about to take will be her
    first semester-long team project at university. This guide will help her and
    her teammates figure out what to do when.

-   Ahmadou worked as an illustrator for several years before doing an intensive
    14-week conversion course to become a JavaScript developer. He has a lot of
    experience working in teams to meet deadlines, but is still often bewildered
    by the tools, jargon, and culture of programming. This guide will help him
    figure out what his new colleagues think is "normal".

-   Sharla teaches JavaScript at Tanesya's college and for the conversion course
    that Ahmadou went through. They taught the "Introduction to Software
    Engineering" class last semester, and were disappointed by how much time
    they and their students wasted. This guide will help them give more
    structure to the next offering and set more realistic expectations.

Like these three personas, readers should:

-   Be able to write multi-page programs in C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, or
    some other modern programming language.

-   Be able to create static web sites using HTML and CSS.

-   Know how to use [Git][git] to save and share files. (It's OK not to know
    [the more obscure commands][git-man-page-generator].)
