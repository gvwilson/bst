## Who this book is for

Every lesson should be written with specific learners in mind.
These three [personas][t3-personas] are ours:

-   AÃ¯sha started writing VB macros for Excel in an accounting course and never looked back.
    She has spent the last three years doing front-end JavaScript work
    and now wants to learn how to build back-end applications.
    This material will fill in some gaps in her programming knowledge
    and teach her some common design patterns.

-   Rupinder is studying computer science degree at college.
    He has learned more about the theory of algorithms than about building software,
    and while he uses Git and unit testing tools on a daily basis,
    he doesn't feel he understands how they work.
    This material will give him a better understanding of those tools
    and of how to design some of his own.

-   Yim builds mobile apps for a living
    but also teaches two courses at Rupinder's college:
    one on full-stack web development using JavaScript and [Node][nodejs] (which they are quite proud of),
    and another titled "Software Design".
    They are frustrated that so many books about the latter talk about the subject in the abstract
    and use examples that their students can't relate to.
    This material will fill those gaps
    and give them starting points for a wide variety of course assignments.

Like these three personas, readers should:

-   Know how to write JavaScript programs using loops, arrays, functions, objects, and classes.

-   Know how to create static web pages using HTML and CSS.

-   Be able to install [Node][nodejs] on their computer
    and run programs with it from the Unix or Windows command line.

-   Use [Git][git] to save and share files.
    (It's OK not to know [the more obscure commands][git-man-page-generator].)

-   Be able to explain what a tree is and how to visit the nodes in one recursively.
    (These are the most complicated data structure and algorithm we *don't* explain.)
