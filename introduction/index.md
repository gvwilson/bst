Three books changed my life as a programmer. <cite>Kernighan1981</cite> taught
me that I could do more than just write software---I could *design* it---while
<cite>Glass2002</cite> taught me that we could study software and the software
development process just as we would study anything else in engineering, and
that by doing so we could prove or invalidate claims about what works and what
doesn't.

In between them I read <cite>Hunt1999</cite>, as did many other programmers of
my generation. For most of us, it was the first time someone had described the
craft of software construction in a way that made sense. When I began
supervising undergraduate student projects at the University of Toronto in the
early 2000s, I referred to it over and over again.

Looking at it and at its twentieth anniversary edition <cite>Thomas2019</cite>
now, I am struck by how useful its advice continues to be, but I'm also struck
by what *isn't* there. How do you run a meeting in a way that ensures everyone
is heard? After working in and around programming for forty years, I believe
knowing that is more useful than knowing what <g key="design-by-contract">design
by contract</g> is. Why and how are tech companies so hostile to women, people
of color, and members of the LGBT community? The evidence that they are is much
stronger than the evidence supporting the use of <g key="tdd">test-driven
development</g>.  And given how online platforms have fueled radicalization and
disinformation, shouldn't every book on how to be a better programmer at least
mention them?

This book can't cover everything that those three did, but if you are an
undergraduate student embarking on a semester-long software project as part of a
team, it will give you the tools you need to succeed. Its aim is to teach you
how to be a *compassionate programmer*---one who cares as much about the
well-being of their colleagues and users as they do about their own. This focus
is not purely selfless: treating other people as if they are as important as
yourself also makes your life easier, not least because you-in-the-future is one
of the people you're helping.

## Audience

Every lesson should be written with specific learners in mind.  These three
[personas][t3-personas] are ours:

-   Tanesya is in the third year of a four-year computer science degree. She worked
    on several volunteer projects in high school and through her mosque, but the
    "Introduction to Software Engineering" course she's about to take will be her
    first semester-long team project at university. This guide will help her and
    her teammates figure out what to do when.

-   Ahmadou worked as an illustrator for several years before doing an intensive
    14-week conversion course to become a JavaScript developer. He has a lot of
    experience working in teams to meet deadlines, but is still often bewildered
    by the tools, jargon, and culture of programming. This guide will help him
    figure out what his new colleagues think is "normal".

-   Sharla teaches JavaScript at Tanesya's college and for the conversion course
    that Ahmadou went through. They taught the "Introduction to Software
    Engineering" class last semester, and were disappointed by how much time
    they and their students wasted. This guide will help them give more
    structure to the next offering and set more realistic expectations.

Like these three personas, readers should:

-   Be able to write multi-page programs in C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, or
    some other modern programming language.

-   Be able to create static web sites using HTML and CSS.

-   Know how to use [Git][git] to save and share files. (It's OK not to know
    [the more obscure commands][git-man-page-generator].)

## Topics

Life is short and your project is even shorter, so this book focuses on the
handful of tools and techniques that will help you the most in the short and
medium term:

-   How to work effectively in a small team when you are constantly being
    interrupted by other tasks like the homework for your other courses.

-   What tools you should use to build, test, deploy, and describe software
    in less time and with less pain.

-   How to design a program (or a set of related programs) that will take
    several weeks to write.

-   How a few simple changes in your study habits will enable you to learn more
    and more quickly.

-   What legal rights you have to the software you create as a student (and on
    the job).

-   What we actually know about software development and why we believe it's
    true.

-   What to do when things go wrong.

think about how programmers think and work.
